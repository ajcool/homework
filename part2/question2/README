I have implemented the structure defined in the blog post without using a
database. When reading the post, the only thing that I could think of to test
was the organizations that are visible to a given user. On the user model, I
implemented an #organizations method that takes an optional role_type variable.
If passed in, it will limit the organizations to those where the user has that
role_type. An organization that a user has a denied role on will never appear
in the list.

To run the tests, make sure you are using ruby 2.0.0 and have the gem rspec
installed and run 'rspec spec.rb'
